1) Readme.md- I wrote the readme file but it was edited fully by someone else

2) Did researches on the database schema and drew the first database schema https://figma.com/

3) Worked on landing page but was not able to finish. There was a miscommunication so someone else was working on it too and he finished before i did. I still pushed it but closed it without merging it. The link is below

4) We did a password reset link so i had to work on the four pages of the password reset pages, ie, working on the frontend. 
The link to https://github.com/zuri-training/anima_lib_team98/issues/74 and after solving it, this is the link: https://github.com/zuri-training/anima_lib_team98/tree/password-reset-pages
