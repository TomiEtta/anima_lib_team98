1) Readme.md- I wrote the readme file but it was edited fully by someone else

2) Did researches on the database schema and drew the first database schema https://figma.com/

3) Worked on landing page but was not able to finish. There was a miscommunication so someone else was working on it too and he finished before i did. I still pushed it but closed it without merging it.

4) We did a password reset link so i had to work on the four pages of the password reset pages, ie, working on the frontend. The link to https://github.com/zuri-training/anima_lib_team98/issues/74
Django was allowimg two users to sign up with one email and also not allowing it to log in. I solved this error, i worked on the views.py.
